1. You are simulating a simple network environment, in which Computer1 (A) sends data to Computer2
(B) (Assume that A only sends and B only receives data.) The data link layers of the hosts
are to be simulated. Whenever a packet from the network layer arrives at the data link layer, the
sender encapsulates the packet (datagram) into a link layer frame and sends it to the receiver. If
the receiver receives the frame without errors during transmission, it sends an ACK frame to the
sender. Note that frames can be lost or corrupted during transmissions. In this case, retransmission
of frames should be handled by Stop-and-Wait ARQ. Assume that

(a) It randomly takes [1,10] msec for a frame to travel from A to B (i.e., propagation time). So
the average round trip time (RTT) between two hosts can be assumed to be 11 (=5.5*2) msec.
Assume a very high speed link between the hosts so that the frame transmission time can be
ignored.

(b) Assume that packets arrive at the link layer randomly with the average rate of (1/20) packets/
msec and the size of a packet is 2000 bytes.

(c) The header of a frame contains a Sequence number and an ACK number.

(d) Note that the time-out values of timers should be a little greater than RTT, e.g., 15 msec.

(e) Frames may be corrupted or lost during transmission. You may simulate the frame corruption/
loss by randomly generating frame corruptions/losses with the frame error probability of
pe(0 < pe < 1).

(f) Assume that the number of re-transmissions Nr = 3, i.e., if a frame is re-transmitted more
than Nr, it is dropped.

2. You need to provide the followings for simulation setup. (A user types in the following information
when a simulation starts.)
(a) Simulation time (T)
(b) Frame loss probability (p_l)
(c) Frame coruption probability (p_c)

3. Output :
(a)All the activities in every timeline at which any critical event(send, receive, etc) occurs.
(b)Number of successfully sent frames.
(c)Number of dropped(failed) frames.
